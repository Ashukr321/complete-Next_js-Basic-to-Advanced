## Project Setup üßë‚Äçüíª
### 1.Code Editor 
### 2.Node js 
### 3.Installation

    npx create-next-app@latest
  
### 4. install dependencies
    npm install 
### 5. start server 
    npm run dev 

### 6. open browser 
    http://localhost:3000/

### 7. folder structure
1.package.json
    * this contains  project dependencies 
  
      {
      "name": "myapp1",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "private": true,
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "lint": "next lint"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "myapp1": "file:",
        "next": "15.0.2",
        "react": "19.0.0-rc-02c0e824-20241028",
        "react-dom": "19.0.0-rc-02c0e824-20241028"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@types/node": "^20",
        "@types/react": "^18",
        "@types/react-dom": "^18",
        "eslint": "^8",
        "eslint-config-next": "15.0.2",
        "postcss": "^8",
        "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
        "typescript": "^5"
      }
    }
  dev -> for the devlopment purpose 
  build -> for the build purpose production 
#  
2.next.config.ts 
* this file is used for the configuration of the next js
#
3..next folder 
* this will generate  when we run the project either in production or development mode
* From this folder our next js application will be served


#
4.Node modules folder 
* this folder store all the dependencies of the project 
* this will created when we run npm install commands
#
5. public folder  
* this will hold all the static files that serve 
#
6. src folder 
* in this folder we have another folder that is app folder 
* src > app this is newly introduced in the app router 
# 
7. src > app 
* inside the app folder we have 4 files 
 > 1. favicon.ico
 > 2. global.css -> global styles for app 
 > 3. layout.tsx -> shared across diff. pages
 > 4. page.tsx ->unique ui that show on visiting   this is children props in the layout.tsx to form a complete ui
 
#
## 8 . Server components 

* next js all components are server components by default
* we don't have capabilities to use hooks 
* To create client components it is necessary to add "use client" at top of the components file 
#

## 9 . Routing 
* Next js have file system  based routing mechanism
* url path that can access in the browser

### 10  Routing convention üöÄ
* All Routes be placed inside the app folder 
* Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.jsx or page.tsx
* Every folder to a path segment in the browser 

### 11 Nested Routing
![estedroutes ](myapp1/data/nestedroutes.png)


### 12 Dynamic Routing 
![dynamic ](myapp1/data/dynamic.png)

* we have to create folder using [id]

### 13 Nested Dynamic Routing

### 14 Catch all Segment 
* [...slug]

### 15 Not Found Page 
* to create not found page we have to create a page in app folder 
* not-found.tsx 

## 16 File Co_location 
## Private folder 
* A private folder indicated that it is a private  implementation details and should not be considered  by the next js routing systemüî•
* to create private folder we have to use _ underscore to make it private 

## 17 Routes Group üî•üî• 
* Related Routes are grouped together
* it allow us to logically group the routes without affecting the  url path structure 
* For creating the routes group we have to use the ( ) all related routes are wrapped inside ()
  
examples: 

      (auth)
        >login
          page.tsx
        >register
          page.tsx

## 18 layout 
* share between multiple layouts 
>
    import React from 'react'

    const layout = ({children}:{
      children:React.ReactNode;
    }) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>layout</h1>
          <main>{children}</main>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default layout

## 19 Nested layout 

## 20 Routes grouped layout

## 21 Routing MetaData 
* it is crucial for the seo and visibility 
* Next js introduce  Metadata api  , it allow you to defined each page metaData 
* it must have to export the metadata object 
* two ways to implement 
* 1 in the layout.tsx 
* 2 in the page.tsx
>
    export const metadata = {
      title:"about us page"
    }
* dynamic metadata 
>
    import React from 'react';
    import { Metadata } from 'next';

    type Props = {
      params: {
        productId: string;
      };
    };

    // Function to generate metadata for the page
    export const generateMetadata = ({ params }: Props): Metadata => {
      return {
        title: `Product ${params.productId}`,
      };
    };

    // Main component for the page
    const Page = ({ params }: Props) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Product {params.productId} Details</h1>
        </div>
      );
    };
    export default Page;
#
## 22 title metadata
>
    export const metadata: Metadata = {
      title:{
        absolute:"",
        default: "Ashutosh  kumar next js ",
        template:"%s | Ashutosh", // this is used for dynamic
      },
      description: "Generated by create next app",
    };


##  23 Link component of Next js 
* Link is the react component that extends anchor tag html element

      <Link href={'/about'}>about</Link>

## 24 Active link 

## 25 Navigating Programmatically 
>
    import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

    const router = useRouter();
    router.push('/');
## 26 Loading ui 

## 27 Error Handling 
* ErrorBoundary component must be client component
> 
    "use client"
    const ErrorBoundary = ({error}:{
      error: Error
    }) => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>{error.message}</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }

    export default ErrorBoundary


## 28 Recovering from Error 

    "use client"
        const ErrorBoundary = ({error,reset}:{
          error: Error,
          reset: () =>void,
        }) => {
          return (
            <div>
              <h1>{error.message}</h1>
              <button onClick=(reset)>Try Again</button>
            </div>
          )
        }
      export default ErrorBoundary
* we also have to make page.tsx as client component
* when we switch within the ui other slots is unaffected




## 29 Parallel Routes 
Parallel routes are an advanced routing mechanism that allows for the simultaneous rendering of multiple pages within the same layout.


* Use the @folder naming convention to define ‚≠ê slots ‚≠ê for your routes.
* each slots is passes as a props to its corresponding layout.tsx file


## Unmatched routes 
* when page reload  next js immediately search for  default.tsx page with in each un match  slot
* default.tsx not found then next js render 404 page
